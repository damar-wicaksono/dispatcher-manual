The main tasks of the Dispatcher module, as depicted in the figure, are to:

- prepare a dispatch package which includes the relevant data and scripts to be executed in the remote machine;
- send the package over network using SSH protocol to the remote machine;
- organize the execution of the function in the remote machine;
- fetch the results back to the local MATLAB/UQLab session.

> **Note**: Not all the available functionalities of UQlab are _Dispatcher-aware_; only the _Dispatcher-aware_ functions can be dispatched using the Dispatcher module (see Section for details)
